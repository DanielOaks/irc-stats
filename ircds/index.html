<p>
This is a set of statistics retrieved from various IRC networks. How many networks were queried is shown. These stats <strong>do not</strong> represent every IRC network out there, just the ones we've been able to scan. Specific versions are normalized to just the IRCd version number <code>(x{.x}, i.e. 3.5.2)</code>, and other information is ignored when assembling that table.
</p>
<div class="warning">
	<p>Statistics are often misleading and can be used to push agendas based on how they are presented. The statistics here <strong>ARE NOT</strong> normalised or weighted based on user count, and we <strong>DO NOT</strong> filter out networks with very low numbers of users.</p>
	<p>These stats present a misleading picture of the IRC software and features typically encountered by users because they are presented based only on sheer number of instances. Adding <a href="https://github.com/ircdocs/irc-stats/issues/6">weighting</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ircdocs/irc-stats/issues/14">filtering based on user count</a> is planned, but hasn't been implemented yet simply due to time.</p>
	<p>Don't trust these statistics. Don't trust <strong>ANY</strong> IRC statistics unless you can see exactly how they are weighted / processed, and experiment with how weighting and filtering based on user counts and other metrics changes the stats to give you a more complete picture of them.</p>
</div>
<p>
	This site is a <strong>WORK IN PROGRESS</strong> and will be updated as the statistics collection and display is improved. These statistics <strong>should not</strong> be used in anything other than curiosity's sake at this point.

<h2>IRCd Software</h2>

<p>
	This represents the IRC daemons we found in use when connecting to networks. Major versions of IRC daemons are displayed separately. Network-specific versions of IRC daemons are generally displayed as a part of the original IRC daemon.
