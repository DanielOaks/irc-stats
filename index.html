<p>
	This is a set of statistics retrieved from various IRC networks. How many networks were queried is shown in each set of data. These stats <strong>do not</strong> represent every IRC network out there, just the ones we've been able to scan. We focus on networks designed for actual chatting, rather than to showcase or prototype a single piece of IRC software (to more accurately represent what most users are connecting to).
</p>
<p>
	These stats are intended to be useful to people writing IRC protocol documentation, specifications and software, so they can know what already exists out there and how it tends to be used. This site does not and will not show network names, hostnames or IP addresses, just anonymised data to help IRC software / specification developers and people documenting the protocol.
</p>
<p>
	This site is a <strong>WORK IN PROGRESS</strong> and will be updated as the statistics collection and display is improved. These statistics <strong>should not</strong> be used in anything other than curiosity's sake at this point.
