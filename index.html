<p>
	This is a set of statistics retrieved from various IRC networks. How many networks were queried is shown in each set of data. These stats <strong>do not</strong> represent every IRC network out there, just the ones we've been able to scan. We focus on networks designed for actual chatting, rather than to showcase or prototype a single piece of IRC software (to more accurately represent what most users are connecting to).
</p>
<p>
	These stats are intended to be useful to people writing IRC protocol documentation, specifications and software, so they can know what already exists out there and how it tends to be used. This site does not and will not show network names, hostnames or IP addresses, just anonymised data to help IRC software / specification developers and people documenting the protocol.
</p>
<div class="warning">
	<p>Statistics are often misleading and can be used to push agendas based on how they are presented. The statistics here <strong>ARE NOT</strong> normalised or weighted based on user count, and we <strong>DO NOT</strong> filter out networks with very low numbers of users.</p>
	<p>These stats present a misleading picture of the IRC software and features typically encountered by users because they are presented based only on sheer number of instances. Adding <a href="https://github.com/ircdocs/irc-stats/issues/6">weighting</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ircdocs/irc-stats/issues/14">filtering based on user count</a> is planned, but hasn't been implemented yet simply due to time.</p>
	<p>Don't trust these statistics. Don't trust <strong>ANY</strong> IRC statistics unless you can see exactly how they are weighted / processed, and experiment with how weighting and filtering based on user counts and other metrics changes the stats to give you a more complete picture of them.</p>
</div>
<p>
	This site is a <strong>WORK IN PROGRESS</strong> and will be updated as the statistics collection and display is improved. These statistics <strong>should not</strong> be used in anything other than curiosity's sake at this point.
