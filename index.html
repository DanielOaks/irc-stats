<p>
	This is a set of statistics retrieved from various IRC networks. How many networks were queried is shown in each set of data. These stats <strong>do not</strong> represent every IRC network out there, just the ones we've been able to scan.
</p>
<p>
	This site is a <strong>WORK IN PROGRESS</strong> and will be updated as the statistics collection and display is improved. These statistics <strong>should not</strong> be used in anything other than curiosity's sake at this point.
